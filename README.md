# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Description:
This Code Quiz application is a timed quiz consisting of multiple choice questions. To develop this application, about 50% of codes belong to Javascript, about 30% of HTML and remaining portion consist CSS codes.
# How it functions?
At first, user will have to enter their name which will be stored in local storage after "Start Quiz" is pressed. If user does not enter name, alert "Please enter your name" will be displayed. As soon as "Start Quiz" is pressed after entering the name, user will be provided with questions with four options, which has one right answer. If user clicks right answer, gets 10 points and for wrong answer clicked 5 points will be deducted. The final total score will be stored in local storage and displayed at the end of the quiz. Also, user will be given 60 seconds to complete the quiz, so timer will be counting down from 60 to 0 that will be displayed on the screen as "Time Left: -- seconds". If user completes quiz before timer gets 0, timer will stop.

## Experience:
I used basic concepts of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to develope this Code Quiz application. I found this project is more challenging and time-taking than previous 3 projects. At first, I had no idea how to plan and accomplish this project but with the help class activities, some learnings from websites, tutors and TAs were very helpful. As I am still learning, new codes everyday, it took me a while to figure out to complete the project.
